## 2. Use cases

1.  I want to know how long it will take me to get from one destination to the other.
2.	Some children don't know what they want for Christmas! Help me choose a gift for an undecisive child.
3.	I want to have my own Advent calendar with a movie recommendation for each day, so that me and Ms. Santa can sip hot cocoa and watch cozy movies. 
4.	I want to know which toy store is closest to a child, so that my reindeer fly efficiently. 
5.	I would like to have the ability to talk to the children (e.g., queue-based app)
6.	I want to have a virtual wish list manager so that I and my elves can keep track of the gifts that children around the world are asking for.
